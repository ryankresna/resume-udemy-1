    <p>
      My hobby is coding as a web developer. I enjoy creating and developing
      websites, working with various programming languages like HTML, CSS, and
      JavaScript. I love solving problems, learning new technologies, and
      continuously improving my skills to build efficient and user-friendly web
      applications.
